# cm_inch_converter_app

## Information

* Basic application that can convert centimeters taken as input and gives output in inches
* First application created on my path of learning Android Studio
* Currently the application is under development and MUCH improvements will be made in the future as I continue to learn using Android Studio
* I intend to make a fully functioning "unit converter" app out of this. Bear with me since I'm really noob and still learning
